This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Razorpay Payment Integration

This application includes Razorpay payment gateway integration for profile analysis services.

### Setup

1. Create a Razorpay account at [https://razorpay.com](https://razorpay.com)
2. Obtain your API keys from the Razorpay dashboard
3. Add the following environment variables to your `.env` file:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=your_razorpay_key_id_here
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=your_razorpay_key_secret_here
```

### How It Works

- Users must complete payment before accessing profile analysis features
- Payment is processed through Razorpay checkout
- All payments are verified server-side for security

For detailed setup instructions, see [RAZORPAY_SETUP.md](RAZORPAY_SETUP.md).
